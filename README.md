For a long time, I had been using an Dashboard purchased from Theme Forest. Although I had established most of its features, I grew tired of its design and was looking for a change.

When a friend showed me Shopify's Dashboard, I was not only impressed by its design but also captivated by its functionality. I felt struck by it and started looking for ways to get a similar dashboard. I checked platforms like GitHub for an HTML version but couldn’t find one.

Then, during one of those crazy nights, I asked myself, "Why don’t I just create it myself?" And so, I started working on it. As I am a back-end engineer, I wanted to experiment with new libraries while writing the front-end. I tried tools like Tailwind (I previously used Sass) and Flowbite, which were new to me. Due to my limited knowledge of JS, I also relied on my old friend jQuery whenever I got stuck.

I will continue to develop this project. If you are looking for something similar and would like to contribute, I would be happy to develop it together.
